                 <p class="pt-3">Table Banking is a group-based funding system where members of a group
                    meet weekly and make weekly savings to form a kitty from which members can borrow.
                    Each member’s contributions are recorded in her passbook and referred to as her share.
                    The minimum contribution per week, which can be as low as Ksh 25 (20p), is set in the
                    group’s constitution, which is written by the group itself. Thus it is set with the members’</p>
